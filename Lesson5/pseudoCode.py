#pick random word mystery word (maybe import random idk??)
#make blank word same length as mystery word, for every letter a _

#set lives = number of allowed wrong guesses
#make empty list guessed letters

#while lives is greater than zero and word not guessed
    #show blank word with guessed letters filled in
    #show lives left
    #ask player for letter guess
    #if letter already guessed
        #tell player guess again
         #add letter to guessed letters
    #if letter in mystery word
        #reveal letter in blank word
    #else
        #subtract one from lives
        #draw next spider part

#if word guessed
    #say player wins
#else
    #say spider fully drawn and player loses
    #show mystery word
